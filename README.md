## Hashes Generator
If you'd like to contribute, you can use the hashes-generator.php included. Kudos to [mattyrob](http://subscribe2.wordpress.com/) (more life points for you!) for creating it.

As well as using the instructions below, you can now use the generator on the command line, like so;
`$ php hashes-generator.php > hashes-3.9.php`

### Instructions
1. Download the zipped version of WordPress and save it to the same location as the hashes-generator.php script
2. Make sure the zip is called 'latest.zip'
3. Run the hashes-generator.php script in a browser
4. Copy the resultant code and paste into a new file
5. Save that file as hashes-x.php where x is the WordPress version number. Examples:
    * WordPress 3.7.1 = hashes-3.7.1.php
    * WordPress 3.8 = hashes-3.8.php
    * WordPress 3.8.1 = hashes-3.8.1.php
